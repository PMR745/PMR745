            <h3 class="head">Coding Journey</h3>
            I was in standard 11th when I first came to know about coding. But I actually begin my coding journey in 12th standard, when the whole world was locked inside their house due to lockdown, where I started with HTML as my first step towards coding. With HTML I also focused on some basic CSS. Later started exploring JavaScript for logic building of websites. Then I created my first project which is Calculator, later on kept on creating some different projects like Hand Cricket with computer, Basic Login page, etc. Then I started with one of the most popular language which is also my favourite one that is C++. Created some small projects like Calculator, ATM, Quiz Game, etc.
            <br>
            Now I knew that this is what I enjoy doing so here I am now in this profession.
